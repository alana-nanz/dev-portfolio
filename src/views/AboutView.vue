		<p>Currently, I'm a <strong>Developer</strong> at <a href="https://cylndr.com/" target="_blank">Cylndr Studios</a>, the production team behind advertising agency, <a href="https://mckinney.com/" target="_blank">McKinney</a>. I started as a Junior Developer in 2022 and was promoted after only 18 months. At Cylndr, I've developed multipage websites, landing pages, games, animated banners, and web applications.</p>
		<p>I bring a blend of technical expertise and creative problem-solving to my work after transitioning from a career in nonprofit arts management. I've always been creative, with a strong eye for detail, as evident in my bachelor's degree in piano performance. My work in platforms like WordPress and Drupal intrigued me, so I wanted to see what's under the hood and learn how to code. After creating my first website from scratch, I was hooked!</p>
		<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me doing puzzles, cooking new recipes, walking the local trails with my bernedoodle, or going on adventures with my two daughters and wonderful husband.</p>
